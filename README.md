# PvZ-Replanted-Manual-Archipelago
My take on an implementation of PvZ Replanted Manual Archipelago

Inside this repo, you will find an Archipelago custom world, a YAML file for generation and a save file to use with said Archipelago. This will be played on second adventure.

Starting Items: Sunflower, Peashooter, 1-1 to 1-10, and Lawnmowers

Checks: Completion of Adventure Levels, Minigames, and Puzzles

Items: All Plants, Lawnmower Upgrades, World Unlocks, Mini-games World Unlock, and Puzzles World Unlock

Goal: Beat Dr. Zomboss in Adventure Mode
